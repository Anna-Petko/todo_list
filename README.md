(click "Run" and choose "Edit configuration", and in the field "Main class" put "com.company.Main") and click "Run" button.

Next, you will see main menu. It should look like
>> Welcome to ToDoLy

>> Pick an option:
>> (1) Show Task List (by date or project)
>> (2) Add New Task
>> (3) Edit Task (update, mark as done, remove)

You just need insert the number from "Pick an option". If you want to save your tasks to have them after program is over,
 please don't forget to insert (4). Next time you run your program you will see a file with your tasks,
 and they will be printed out in the (1) and (3) options.

 Also you always can remove your txt file that stores all your tasks (just click the file and choose delete).
